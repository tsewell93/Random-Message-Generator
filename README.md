# Random Message Generator Project

## The Species Generator!

### Project Description
The Species Generator is a program whose function is to discover and catalogue new species of animal! The new species of animal are made up from randomly assigned parts of existing animals - for example an Elephants head, on the body of a Wolf, with the arms of a Monkey and the legs of a Giraffe! It will then assign a random name based on the parts assigned and save the new species as a new animal object. 

The output of running the program will produce a message describing the animals features, and then display further information on the animals object - including species and height! 

### Project Features
This project features functions to produce a random new species from an input array of existing animal, and ultimately outputs a message describing the new animals features, height and weight. 

### How to Use
To execute the program, the user should call the function generateNewSpecies(animalArray) - this will produce a new species and store the object in newSpecies. 

The user should then call buildMessage(newSpecies) to output the message decribing the new species. 

The user can modify the program to produce a greater range of random species by modyfying the array contents of animalArray. 

The user can also modify the number of random names that can be produced by changing the contents of the array latinNames.
