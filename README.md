# Random Message Generator Project

## The Species Generator!

### Project Description
The Species Generator is a program whose function is to discover and catalogue new species of animal! The new species of animal are made up from randomly assigned parts of existing animals - for example an Elephants head, on the body of a Wolf, with the arms of a Monkey and the legs of a Giraffe! It will then assign a random name based on the parts assigned and save the new species as a new animal object. 

The output of running the program will produce a message describing the animals features, and then display further information on the animals object - including species and height!
